"After reading Polycratesâ€™ letter, Amasis understood that it is impossible for a human being to save another human being from what is fated to happen. Polycrates was destined to come to a bad end because his good fortune persisted and he even found what he had thrown away. Therefore he sent a herald to Samos to renounce their bond of guest-friendship, so that when a great and terrible misfortune did befall Polycrates, he would not have to be grief-stricken for a man who was his friend." Herodotus, History, "The Tyrant Polycrates of Samos and his Fate"
