"pius means “dutiful,” one distinguished by
pietās, “dutiful conduct”; while it has religious overtones (duti-
ful conduct to the gods), it is also secular and includes conduct
to others and to the state"

"memorāre sounds like our “remember,” but it
always involves speech: i.e., “mention,” “remind of,” “speak
about.”"
