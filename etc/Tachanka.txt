To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Tachanka Mains. The skill ceiling is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical pro league tactics most of the plays will go over a typical player’s head. There’s also Tachanka’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the Mounted LMG, to realise that it's not just the best gadget in the game- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Tachanka truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Chanka's existential catchphrase “Time to get serious,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ubisoft’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ??

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Tachanka tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 SR points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ???
